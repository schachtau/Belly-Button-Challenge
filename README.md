Belly Button Diversity Study

            This is an example of how data analytics can be applied to any industry. Come up with a random thought? In 2024 there is a way to gather data, clean if needed, and use the thousands of tools at our disposal to come to a conclusion. This project requires developing an interactive dashboard to look at the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.  Human navels were, "twirrled" to quote the source, and then plated to create a unique microbial "portrait" from each participant. The dashboard includes a bar chart and a bubble chart, showing us the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). D3.js is useful in that it updates the results/charts of each participant when looked at. The dataset is taken from samples.json. The dashboard layout, showcases the charts and individual metadata. The data is simple to access using a dropdown tool to find different participants. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS were the basis/tools for visualization and usage.
